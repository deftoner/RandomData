## Sysmon Dual Process Behavior with Clipboard Monitoring (Event ID 24) ##
##########################################################################

We noticed that on some computers, Sysmon64 had 2 running processes. One is the primary instance (triggered by the Windows service running as SYSTEM), and a secondary instance launched by it with the parameter -z sysclipppc[Hash] (e.g., "C:\windows\sysmon64.exe" -z sysclipppcIF3986D8EED87AAB).
After research and consultation with AI tools pointing to this being a security issue or malware, we confirmed it is not malicious.

Whenever Event ID 24 (ClipboardChange) is present in the Sysmon configuration file—whether explicitly included or excluded—Sysmon will spawn a second process for each logged-in user to monitor clipboard activity. This is normal and expected behavior. The -z parameter refers to "System Clipboard RPC" (sysclipppc), though this parameter is undocumented in official Sysmon documentation at the time of this writing.
This secondary process is triggered when the ClipboardChange rule exists in your config, for example:

-- Code --
    <!--SYSMON EVENT ID 24 : CLIPBOARD EVENT MONITORING [ClipboardChange]-->
        <!--EVENT 24: "Clipboard changed"-->
        <!--COMMENT:    Sandbox usage.  Sysmon can capture the contents of clipboard events.
            An  example of what could be a production usage on restricted desktops is provided below, but it is commented-out. -->
            
        <!--DATA: EventType, UtcTime, ProcessGuid, ProcessId, Image, Session, ClientInfo, Hashes, Archived -->

    <RuleGroup name="" groupRelation="or">
        <ClipboardChange onmatch="exclude" />
    </RuleGroup>
-- EOF Code --
Or even when explicitly excluding it:

-- Code --
<RuleGroup name="" groupRelation="or">
    <ClipboardChange onmatch="exclude" />
</RuleGroup>
-- EOF Code --

and/or 

-- Code --
`- ClipboardChange onmatch: exclude` :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
-- EOF Code --

To prevent the secondary process from spawning: Remove the <ClipboardChange> rule entirely from your configuration file. By default, Sysmon will not monitor events that are not defined in the config file.

PD: I bet you thought that was suspicious that sysmon was running inside c:\windows and not c:\windows\system32, me too, it installs in c:\windows by default, dont worry, its normal
